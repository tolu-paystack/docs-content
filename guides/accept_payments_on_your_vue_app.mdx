	<h1>Accept Payments on your Vue App</h1>
  <Callout type="summary" title="In a nutshell">
  	Need to start accepting payments through your Vue app? In this article, we'll be exploring how to connect Paystack with your Vue app. We'll be using a sample checkout page on a donation form for our demo

## Introduction

<Callout type="info" title="Before you begin">
  You should <a href="https://dashboard.paystack.com/#/signup" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">create a free Paystack account</a>. We'll provide you with test keys that you can use to make test your integration.
</Callout>

We're going to use our public keys for this demo. To get your public key, login into your Paystack dashboard and click on the <a href="https://dashboard.paystack.com/#/settings/developer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Settings tab</a>, and then click on API Keys & Webhooks.

You'll notice you have two public keys: Test and Live. While building your app, it's a good idea to use your test keys, as this will allow you to simulate transactions. Once your app is production-ready, you can switch over to your live keys.

<Callout type="danger" title="Never use secret keys on client-side">
  Since this is a client-side integration, it means that our API keys will be exposed. To prevent anyone gaining access to our Paystack account, we want to make sure we're using our <strong>public keys</strong>. Secret keys should only ever be used on the server.
</Callout>


## Project Setup

If you’re already familiar with Vue, then this section would be pretty familiar to you and you can skip to the next section, <a href="#install-paystack">Installing Paystack</a>. If not, VueJS is a Javascript library used for building frontend applications. NPM and Yarn are popular installation methods when building large scale applications with Vue.

```bash
npm install -g @vue/cli
# OR
yarn global add @vue/cli
```

Once it’s installed, navigate to your desired folder and create a new Vue project;

```bash
vue create project_name
```

The terminal would show you a couple of preset configurations, as a beginner, it’s recommended to choose the default. This would create a sample project `project_name` in the current directory. For the purpose of this guide, I’ll be creating a simple charity form to collect a user name, email address, and accepts payment from donors.

Here’s my `App.vue` snippet:

```jsx
<template>
  <div id="app">
    <section>
      <h1>Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit Amet</h1>
      <div class="formcontainer">
        <hr />
      <div class="container">
        <label for="uname">
          <strong>Full Name</strong>
        </label>
        <input v-model="full_name" required type="text" placeholder="John Doe" name="uname" />
        <label for="email">
          <strong>Email Address</strong>
        </label>
        <input v-model="email" required type="text" placeholder="customer@email.com" name="email" />
        <label for="amount">
          <strong>Amount</strong>
        </label>
		    <input v-model="amount" type="tel" placeholder="1000" name="amount" required />
	    </div>
	  </div>
	</section>
	<img style="max-width:200px;" alt="Vue logo" src="./assets/pstk.png" />
  </div>
</template>
<script>
	export default {
	name: "App",
	components: {},
	data: () => {
	return {
		amount: 0,
    full_name: '',
    email: '',
	};
	}
};
</script>
```

## Install Paystack

Now to add the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue-paystack" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paystack Vue package</a>, this package contains the Paystack Inline JS library and the checkout as a single component. To add this plugin to your vue project;

```bash
npm install vue-paystack --save
```

Once it's installed, import the library into your App.vue file like this

```jsx
<script>
import paystack from 'vue-paystack';

export default {
  name: "App",
  components: {
    paystack
  },
  data: () => {
    return {
      amount: null,
      full_name: null,
      email:null
    };
  }
};
</script>
```

Now the component is ready for you to use in the payment form.

## Accept Payments

Now let's add the component to the form. The Paystack component has 5 required props:
<OrderedList items={[
  <span><strong>amount</strong> - The amount we're charging the customer</span>,
  <span><strong>email</strong> - All transactions on Paystack require a customer's email address</span>,
  <span><strong>paystackkey</strong> - Remember, public keys for client-side code always</span>,
  <span><strong>callback</strong> - A function that will run after a successful transaction is completed</span>,
  <span><strong>close</strong> - A function that will run when the customer closes the Paystack Checkout</span>
  ]} 
/> 

```jsx
<paystack
    :amount="amount * 100"
    :email="email"
    :paystackkey="PUBLIC_KEY"
    :reference="reference"
    :callback="processPayment"
    :close="close"
  >
    Make Payment
 </paystack>
```

<Callout type="info" title="Convert amount to a lower denomination">
  The amount entered by the customer should be converted to <code>kobo</code> before it's submitted, this is done by simply multiplying the value by <code>100</code>
</Callout>

The unique reference field is auto generated, and the email and amount fields are collected from the user's input. Here are the callback methods:

```jsx
. . . 

computed: {
   reference() {
      let text = "";
      let possible =
        "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789";

      for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++)
        text += possible.charAt(Math.floor(Math.random() * possible.length));

      return text;
    }
  },
  methods: {
    processPayment: () => {
      window.alert("Payment recieved")
    },
    close: () => {
     console.log("You closed checkout page")
    }
  },

. . .
```

There you have it, our payment integration is now complete. The full code sample is in <a href="https://github.com/PaystackOSS/sample-vue" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this repository</a> and you can check out the <a href="https://elfin-news.surge.sh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">live demo</a>.

We also have another sample sneakers store built in Vue, here's the <a href="https://github.com/PaystackOSS/sample-kix" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> repository</a> and <a href="https://kix.surge.sh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> live demo</a>.
