	<h1>Migrating from InlineJS V1 to V2</h1>
  <p>In this guide, we'll show you how to upgrade to Popup V2 so you can start harnessing more granular controls as you accept payments on your application.</p>
</header>

## What's New
Popup V2 is packed with features that help developers securely customize and gain more control of payments on their frontend applications. 
Some shining new features available on Popup V2 are:

<UnorderedList items={[
  "Support for arrow functions", 
  "Initiate a transaction from the API and complete it with Popup",
  "Reduced transaction abandonment rate",
  "Access to transaction status",
  "Programmatically close Popup",
  "And more..."
  ]} 
/>


## Updating dependency
You can install Popup V2 based on your workflow and preference:

<Tabs links={{html: "CDN", bash: "NPM", shell: "Yarn"}} filepath="/guides/migrating_from_inlinejs_v1_to_v2/dependency.js" />

If you used `NPM` or `Yarn`, kindly ensure you import the library:
```js
import PaystackPop from '@paystack/inline-js';
```

## Updating methods
There are subtle differences when initializing a transaction on Popup V1 and V2. In order to ensure a smooth transition, we'll highlight 
the differences and show you how to update the necessary methods and params.

### Initialization
With Popup V1, transactions are initialized with the `PaystackPop.setup()` method. Popup is then triggered by calling the `openIframe()` method:
```js
let paystack = PaystackPop.setup({
  key: 'pk_domain_xxxxxxxxxx',
  email: 'example@email.com',
  amount: 10000
});

paystack.openIframe();
```


Dang! That's so old school. In V2, we dropped the `openIframe()` method. A transaction can be initialized like this:

```js
const paystack = new PaystackPop();
paystack.newTransaction({
	key: 'pk_domain_xxxxxxxxxx',
	email: 'example@email.com',
	amount: 10000
});
```

### Callbacks
Callbacks are used to get the state of payment. New callbacks are introduce in V2:

<Tabs links={{javascript: "Version 1"}} filepath="/guides/migrating_from_inlinejs_v1_to_v2/callback_v1.js" />
<Tabs links={{javascript: "Version 2"}} filepath="/guides/migrating_from_inlinejs_v1_to_v2/callback_v2.js" />

The `callback()` method which indicates a successful transaction has now been replaced with the `onSuccess()` callback. The `onClose()` method, which lets you know when a user closed Popup, has now been replaced with `onCancel()`.

Also notice that V2 allows you make use of arrow functions. Heck! Keep the extra key strokes for something else.

Let's go live! Test your integration to ensure it works as expected. If you experience any issue, kindly shoot a mail to support@paystack.com
