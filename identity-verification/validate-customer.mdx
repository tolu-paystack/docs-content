## Introduction

The customer validation endpoint is used to verify identification details provided by your customers. You can validate a customer by sending a <code>POST</code> request to the <ApiLink title="Validate Customer" path="customer-validate" /> endpoint.

## Bank Account Validation
Bank account validation requires that you provide the customer's BVN and a bank account connected to that BVN. 

<RequestResponse links={{bash: "cURL", js: "Node", php: "PHP"}} filepath="/identity/validate-customer/request-2.0.js" />

### Testing
Customers can only be validated with live keys. However, for testing purposes during your integration, you can make make use of this credential with your test key:
<Tabs links={{json: "Test Credential"}} filepath="/identity/validate-customer/test-cred-2.0.js" />


## Listen for verification status
The verification of the details provided happens asynchronously, and we will send a <code>customeridentification.success</code> or <code>customeridentification.failed</code> event to your webhook URL when the verification is complete.

<TabsMulti language="json" links={{ success: "Customer Identification Success", failed: "Customer Identification Failed" }} filepath="/identity/validate-customer/webhook.js" />

When a customer validation fails, we return the cause of the failure in the `data.reason` parameter. We return the following reasons for a failed customer validation:
<OrderedList items={[
    "Account could not be resolved. Please try again",
    "Account name or BVN is incorrect",
    "Account number or BVN is incorrect"
  ]} 
/>

<Callout type="info" title="A validated customer's name cannot be updated">
 When a customer is validated successfully, the customer's <code>first_name</code> and <code>last_name</code> are automatically updated to correspond with the name on their BVN. 
Once this is set, you'll no longer be able to update the customer's name using the  <ApiLink title="Update Customer" path="customer-update" /> and the customer's name can only be updated by a re-validation.
