    Verify transactions after payments using Paystack's verify API

## How to verify payments
You do this by making a `GET` request to the <ApiLink title="Verify Transaction" path="transaction-verify" /> endpoint from your server using your transaction reference. This is dependent on the method you used to initialize the transaction.

### From Popup or Mobile SDKs
You'll have to send the reference to your server, then from your server you call the verify endpoint.

### From the Redirect API
You initiate this request from your callback URL. The transaction reference is returned as a query parameter to your callback URL.

<Callout type="info" title="Helpful Tip">
	If you offer digital value like airtime, wallet top-up, digital credit, etc, always confirm that you have not already delivered value for that transaction to avoid double fulfillments, especially, if you also use webhooks.
</Callout>

Here's a code sample for verifying transactions:

<RequestResponse links={{bash: "cURL", js: "Node", php: "PHP"}} filepath="/payments/verify-payment/verify.js"  />

<Callout type="warning" title="Warning">
	The API response has a status key <code>response.status</code> indicating the status of the API call. This is <b>not</b> the status of the transaction. The status of the transaction is in the <code>data</code> object in the verify API response, i.e <code>response.data.status</code>.

## Charge returning Users

The `verify` response also returns information about the payment instrument that the user paid with in the `data.authorization` object. If the channel is `card`, then you can store the `authorization_code` for that card against that user, and use that charge the user for subsequent transaction.
