	<Callout type="summary" title="In a nutshell">
    As a Paystack merchant, you can control how a transaction is completed. Our custom filters help ensure this. Custom filters are a metadata object.
  </Callout>
</header>


## Recurring (boolean)
If you need to directly debit the customer in future, specify `recurring=true` under this object to ensure we accept only verve cards that support recurring billing. And force a bank authentication for MasterCard and VISA.


## Banks (array)
If you only want some particular bank(s) cards to be accepted for a transaction, specify the bank codes in the object thus: `banks: ["057","100"]` . To get the list of bank codes supported, please check this API endpoint: <ApiLink title="List Banks" path="miscellaneous-bank" />.

## Card Brands (array)
If you only want some particular card brand(s) to be accepted for a transaction, specify the brands in the object thus: `brands: ["visa","verve"]` 

## Sample

<Tabs links={{json: "JSON"}} filepath="/payments/custom-filters/metadata.js" />

This would mean the transaction is intended to be for enrolling on a recurring billing platform. And we should only accept a visa card from Zenith (057) or Suntrust bank (100).

All keys are optional.
