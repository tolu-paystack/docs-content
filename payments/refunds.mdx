	<Callout type="summary" title="In a nutshell">
		You can repay your customer for a previous transaction in part or fully by initiating a refund and listening to notifications.
	</Callout>
</header>

## Getting started

Sometimes, a customer makes a request for their money after a successful transaction. Other times, an order cannot be fulfilled after payment has been made. 
In either case, you need to consider if you should initiate a:

1. Partial refund or,
2. Full refund

Our <ApiLink title="Refund" path="refund" /> allows you to repay your customers in part or fully. You simply initiate a refund request and we keep you updated on the status of the refund.

## Create a refund

To initiate a refund, you make a `POST` request to the <ApiLink title="Create Refund" path="refund-create" /> and pass the transaction ID or reference in the `transaction` field. If an amount isn't passed, we handle the request as a full refund.

If you want to do a partial refund, you pass an `amount` parameter with the amount to refund. The refund amount must not be more than the original transaction amount.

<RequestResponse
links={{ bash: 'cURL', js: 'Node', php: 'PHP' }}
filepath="/payments/refunds/create-refund.js"
/>

<Callout type="warning" title="Maximum refund amount">
	The refund amount must not be more than the original transaction amount.
</Callout>

## List Refunds

To pull a list of your refunds, you can use the <ApiLink title="List Refunds" path="refund-list" /> to fetch all your refunds.

<RequestResponse
	links={{ bash: 'cURL', js: 'Node', php: 'PHP' }}
	filepath="/payments/refunds/list-refunds.js"
/>

## Refund status

During the lifecycle of a refund, its status changes based on the actions performed by the refund processor. When the status of a refund changes, the status of the associated transaction follows suit.

The table below shows the relationship between the status of a refund and its associated transaction:

<table>
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>Status</th>
			<th>Description</th>
			<th>Transaction Status</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>Pending</td>
			<td>Refund initiated, waiting for response from the processor</td>
			<td>Reversal Pending</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Processing</td>
			<td>Refund has been received by the processor.</td>
			<td>Reversal Pending</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Failed</td>
			<td>
				Refund cannot be processed. Your account is credited with refund amount.
			</td>
			<td>Success</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Processed</td>
			<td>Refund has successfully been processed by the processor.</td>
			<td>Reversed</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>
<Callout type="info" title="Processed Refunds">
	When a refund is marked as <code>processed</code>, it may still take up to 10 business days for customers to receive their funds.
</Callout>

## Listen to notifications
