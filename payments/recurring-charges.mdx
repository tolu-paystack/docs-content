	<h1>Recurring Charges</h1>
	<Callout type="summary" title="In a nutshell">
      Once a customer has made the first successful payment with their card, you can store the customer's card authorization and use it for subsequent transactions. <strong>This currently only works for card!</strong>
  </Callout>
</header>

## Charge the first transaction

You can initialize this first charge from web or your mobile app. Check out the different <Link to="/libraries-and-plugins">integration methods for web and mobile</Link>.

### Why do I need to charge the user to add their cards?
<OrderedList items={[
  <span>Local regulations require that users authenticate the card through <code>2FA</code> in an initial transaction before we can charge the card subsequently.</span>,
  <span>It allows us to ensure that the card is valid and can be charged for subsequent transactions.</span>
  ]} 
/>

<Callout type="warning" title="Minimum charge amount">
  <p>The minimum amount we recommend for the first charge is <strong>NGN 50.00</strong>, <strong>GHS 0.10</strong>, <strong>ZAR 1.00</strong>, or <strong>USD 0.20</strong>. Lower amounts are not guaranteed to work on all card brands or banks.</p> 
  <p>It is standard practice to credit the user back with value (in your app) worth the tokenization amount, or simply refund the money back.</p>
</Callout>


## Get the Card authorization

If the first transaction is successful, you can listen to events on <Link to="/payments/webhooks">your webhook endpoint</Link>. Alternatively, you can use the <ApiLink title="Verify Transaction" path="transaction-verify" /> endpoint to confirm the status of the transaction. In either case, the response looks like the sample below:

<Tabs links={{json: "JSON"}} filepath="/payments/recurring-charges/authorization.js" />

You'll notice that the `data` object in the response contains an `authorization` object within it, which contains the details of the payment instrument (card in this case) that the user paid with.

      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table> 


## Store the authorization

Next, you need to store the `authorization` and the `email` used for the transaction. These details can be used to charge the card subsequently. Every payment instrument that is used on your site/app has a unique `signature` . The `signature` can be used to ensure that you do not save an authorization multiple times.

<Callout type="info" title="Note">
  <p>It is important to store the entire <code>authorization</code> object in order not to lose any context regarding the card.</p> 
  <p>It is also important to store the email used to create an authorization because only the email used to create an authorization can be used to charge it. If you rely on the user's email stored on your system and the user changes it, the authorization can no longer be charged.</p>
</Callout>

When you have the whole authorization object saved, you can display customer payment details at the point of payment to charge recurrently. For example, when the user wants to pay again, you can display the card for the user as **Access Bank Visa card ending with 1234**.

## Charge the authorization

When the user selects the card for a new transaction or when you want to charge them subsequently, you send the `authorization_code`, user's `email` and the `amount` you want to charge to the <ApiLink title="charge authorization" path="transaction-charge-authorization" />.

<RequestResponse links={{bash: "cURL", js: "Node", php: "PHP"}} filepath="/payments/recurring-charges/charge-authorization.js" />

<Callout type="info" title="Charging at intervals">
  If your application needs to charge the authorizations at certain intervals, it means your server needs to have a cron job that runs at particular intervals and picks all the authorizations that needs to be charged.
</Callout>

## Two Factor Authentication
<Callout type="info" title="Feature Availability">
  By default, this feature is available to betting merchants with a Nigerian integration and specific to cards issued by Guarantee Trust Bank (GTB), Access Bank, United Bank for Africa (UBA), Zenith Bank & First Bank of Nigeria. If you have a 
  Nigerian integration and would like to get this feature, kindly send an email to <strong>support@paystack.com</strong>
</Callout>

Two Factor Authentication (2FA) is an extra security step taken to confirm that you aren’t processing the request of a malicious actor. The user 
making the request is generally asked to provide some form of information that is unique to them.

In order to ensure a user’s card isn’t being used by a malicious actor, we challenge the user by asking the user to authorize the transaction. 
Authorization can be done by using a hardware token, OTP, PIN + OTP, or 3DS.

The request to charge the card remains the same. However, the response is different for cards that will be challenged:

<Tabs links={{json: "JSON"}} filepath="/payments/recurring-charges/two-factor.js" />

When a card is challenged, the response will contain two distinct parameters among others:
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Parameter</th>
      <th>Type</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr class="odd-row">
      <td>paused</td>
      <td>boolean</td>
      <td>Returns true when a card is being challenged</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>authorization_url</td>
      <td>string</td>
      <td>A checkout URL for authorization of the transaction</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table> 

You should check the value of the `data.paused` parameter to confirm if a card is being challenged. If it’s being challenged, you should redirect 
the user to the `data.authorization_url` to complete the authorization.

<img alt="Image of the checkout page for user authorization" src="../../assets/images/recurring-charge/two-fa.png" />

On completion of the authorization, we proceed to charge the user's card. You should save the `data.reference` value to verify the status of the 
transaction either via <Link to="/payments/webhooks">webhooks</Link> or the <ApiLink title="verify transaction" path="transaction-verify" />.

### Handling redirect
When the user completes the authorization process, we typically redirect the user back to the callback URL you’ve set on your <a href="https://dashboard.paystack.co/#/settings/developer" target="_blank">Paystack Dashboard</a>. If you want us to redirect to a different URL, you can add the URL to the `callback_url` parameter of your request:

<Tabs links={{json: "JSON"}} filepath="/payments/recurring-charges/callback.js" />

The user might also cancel the authorization process. You can add a URL that the user should be redirected to when they cancel in the 
`metadata` object:

<Tabs links={{json: "JSON"}} filepath="/payments/recurring-charges/metadata.js" />
