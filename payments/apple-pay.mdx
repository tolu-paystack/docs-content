## Activating Apple Pay
You can configure the Apple Pay channel for your web application  on the Paystack Dashboard. 
To enable Apple Pay on your integration, <a href="https://dashboard.paystack.com/#/settings/preferences" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">go to the Preferences page</a> on the Paystack dashboard and check the `Apple Pay` option:


<img alt="Image of the Paystack preferences page showing the checkbox to activate Apple Pay" src="../../assets/images/apple-pay/activate_apple_pay.png" />

Once checked, you'll be prompted to enable Apple Pay by accepting the Apple Pay Platform Web Merchant Terms and Conditions. 
Clicking on the `Enable Apple Pay` button means you've read and accepted the Apple Pay Terms and Conditions:

<Callout type="info" title="Commerce Suite">
  If you make use of our Invoices, Payment Pages or Storefronts, you can now start accepting payments through Apple Pay. Merchants with a custom web application can proceed to the next section to set up Apple Pay for their application.
</Callout>

## Setting up for your web application
Every Apple Pay request needs to be associated with a top-level domain or subdomain. To begin accepting payment with Apple Pay, you need to:

<OrderedList items={[
  <Link to="/payments/apple-pay#register-your-domain">Register your domain</Link>,
  <Link to="/payments/apple-pay#host-your-domain-verification-file">Host your domain verification file</Link>,
  <Link to="/payments/apple-pay#verify-your-domain">Verify your domain</Link>
  ]} 
/>

### Register your domain
On the Paystack Dashboard:
1. <span>Click on the <code>Apple Pay</code> tab on the Settings page</span>
2. <div>
    <span>Under the Web Domains section, click on <code>Add new domain</code> button</span>
    <img alt="Image of the Paystack Apple Pay page, showinfg where to add a domain name" src="../../assets/images/apple-pay/add_domain.png" />
  </div>
3. <div>
    <span>On the modal, add your domain name and download the domain verification file. The verification file will be required in the next step.</span>
    <img alt="Image of the domain verification modal showing a domain name being registeered " src="../../assets/images/apple-pay/filled_domain.png" />
  </div>

<Callout type="info" title="Domain Registration via API">
  If you would rather register your domain via API, kindly check the <ApiLink title="Apple Pay" path="apple-pay" /> endpoint for more details.
</Callout>


### Host your domain verification file
For each top-level domain and/or subdomain registered, you need to host a verification file in the `.well-known` folder in your website's root directory.

For example, if you registered `paystack.com`, then the verification file should reside in: `https://paystack.com/.well-known`.  Likewise, if you registered `music.paystack.com`, the verification file should reside in: `https://music.paystack.com/.well-known`.

Hosting the verification file is a two-step process:
1. Create a `.well-known` folder in your website's root directory
2. Add the verification file previously downloaded to this folder

<img alt="Image of an application folder showing the well known folder used to host the domain verification file" src="../../assets/images/apple-pay/create_well_known.png" />

<Callout type="info" title="Domain Verification File Content-Type">
  Kindly ensure the domain verification file is returned with a <code>content-type</code> of <code>application/text</code>. Using a different <code>content-type</code> could cause your customer's payment to fail.
</Callout>

### Verify your domain
You should now go back to the dashboard to verify your domain. On the `Verify your domain` modal, click the `Verify Domain` button to complete your domain registration. If all goes well, you should get a domain verified message like this:

<img alt="Image of a successful domain verification for Apple Pay" src="../../assets/images/apple-pay/domain_verified.png" />

## Setting up on Popup
<Callout type="info" title="Compatibility">
  Apple Pay works on version 2 of our InlineJS only. If you are using version 1 <Link to="/guides/migrating-from-inlinejs-v1-to-v2">kindly follow this migration guide</Link> before proceeding.
</Callout>

There are two ways to set up Apple Pay in your frontend application:

1. Mounting a payment request button
2. Using a pre-checkout modal

### Mounting a payment request button

This method allows you to position the Apple Pay button in line with your design.  It's a flexible method with a two-step process:

1. Create a container
2. Set up the payment request

#### Create a container

This process involves adding the HTML tags that will house the Apple Pay button as well as the button to load other payment options:
```html
<!-- Payment request buttons, styles and event listeners will be injected to this div -->
<div id="paystack-apple-pay"></div>
<button id="paystack-other-channels">More payment options</button>
```

You should use a `div` tag with a unique `id` for the container of the Apple Pay button. `paystack-apple-pay` is used in the snippet above, however, you can use any name you prefer. This `id` will be used to configure and load the Apple Pay button.

#### Set up the payment request

In order to configure the Apple Pay button, you need to pass the container `id` and the `id` for the other channels in the `paymentRequest()` method:

```js
const paystackPop = new PaystackPop();

await paystackPop.paymentRequest({
  key: 'pk_domain_xxxxx', // Replace with merchant public key
  email: 'CUSTOMER_EMAIL',
  amount: amount * 100, // the amount value is multiplied by 100 to convert to the lowest currency unit
  currency: 'NGN', // Use NGN for Naira or USD for US Dollars
  ref: 'YOUR_REFERENCE', // Replace with a reference you generated
  container: 'paystack-apple-pay', // ID of div to mount payment button elements
  loadPaystackCheckButton: 'paystack-other-channels', // ID of button to trigger opening Paystack checkout. It is optional
  style: { 
    theme: 'dark' // 'light' or 'dark'
    applePay: { 
      margin: '10px',
      padding: '10px',
      width: '100%',
      borderRadius: '5px',
      type: 'pay', // Default value is 'pay'. See other apple pay button types here https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple_pay_on_the_web/displaying_apple_pay_buttons_using_css
      locale: 'en'
    } 
  }, // custom styles for button elements
  onSuccess(response) {
    // do stuff
  },
  onError() {
    // do stuff
  },
  onCancel() {
    // do stuff
  }.
  onElementsMount(elements) { // { applePay: true } or null
    
  }
});
```


### Using a pre-checkout modal

This method doesn't require any additional HTML elements as we do the heavy lifting for you. You can simply tie your payment button to the `checkout()` method:

```js
async funtion payWithPaystack() {

	const paystackPop = new PaystackPop();

	await paystackPop.checkout({
		key: 'pk_domain_xxxxxx',
		email: 'test@gamil.com',
		amount: 10000
	});

}
```

The checkout method checks if the user is on an iOS device or the Safari browser. If the user is on an Apple device, we load a pre-checkout modal that contains the Apple Pay button and a button to load other payment options. Otherwise, we simply load the checkout:

<img alt="Image of a pre-checkout modal on an iPhone" src="../../assets/images/apple-pay/pre_checkout.png" />

## Troubleshooting
If you experience any issues with your Apple Pay integration, kindly ensure there wasn't an oversight during set up:

<UnorderedList items={[
    "Your server must serve all requests via HTTPS",
    <span>You've <Link to="#register-your-domain">registered and verified your domain</Link> on the dashboard</span>,
    <span>You've hosted your domain verification file in the <code>.well-known</code> folder in your website's root directory</span>,
    <span>If your server requires an external server whitelisted before communication can be initiated, you will need to <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple_pay_on_the_web/setting_up_your_server" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">whitelist Apple's IP addresses</a>.</span>
  ]} 
/>
