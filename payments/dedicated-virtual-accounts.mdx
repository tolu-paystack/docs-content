## Introduction
Dedicated Virtual Accounts is a feature on the Paystack Dashboard and API that lets you create dedicated Nigerian bank accounts for your customers to pay you with.

When you create a dedicated virtual account for a customer, all bank transfers to that account will automatically be recorded as transactions from that customer. 

To assign a dedicated virtual account to a customer, you need to:

<OrderedList items={[
  <Link to="/payments/dedicated-virtual-accounts#create-a-customer">Create a customer</Link>,
  <Link to="/payments/dedicated-virtual-accounts#set-up-webhooks">Set up webhooks</Link>,
  <Link to="/payments/dedicated-virtual-accounts#validate-a-customer">Validate a customer</Link>,
  <Link to="/payments/dedicated-virtual-accounts#create-a-dedicated-virtual-account">Create a dedicated virtual account</Link>
]}
/>

## Create a customer
A dedicated virtual account is tied to a customer so you need to create a customer by passing the <code>email</code>, <code>first_name</code>, <code>last_name</code> and <code>phone</code> to the <ApiLink title="Create customer" path="customer-create" />.

If the customer already exists on your platform, kindly ensure the customer's <code>first_name</code>, <code>last_name</code> and <code>phone</code> are set. This is because we need the customer's details to create a bank account. For customers created without these details, you can update the customer record by passing  <code>first_name</code>, <code>last_name</code> and <code>phone</code>  when creating the virtual account with   <ApiLink title="Create Dedicated Virtual Account" path="dedicated-virtual-account-create" />

## Set up webhooks
Bank transfers happen from external sources and we only get notified after the transfer is complete. The only way to know when a payment has been done is <Link to="/payments/webhooks">through webhooks</Link>. 

The `charge.success` webhook event lets you know when you've received a bank transfer payment.
Here's a sample authorization object in the `charge.success` event for a dedicated virtual account payment:

## Validate a customer
For compliance reasons, businesses that offer their services under the business categories - **Betting**, **Financial services**, and **General services** can only generate bank account numbers for customers whose personal identity information has been validated. This information is then used in naming the bank account number. Here's how to   <Link to="/identity-verification/validate-customer" >validate a customer's identity.</Link>

<Callout type="warning" title="Get Customer's Consent">
Generating a dedicated virtual account requires personal customer information, and should only be used with a customer's express consent, not by default.
</Callout>

## Create a dedicated virtual account
To create a dedicated virtual account for a customer, send a `POST` request to our <ApiLink title="Create Dedicated Virtual Account" path="dedicated-virtual-account-create" />.

<Callout type="info" title="Supported banks">
  We currently support Access Bank and Wema Bank. You can get available banks using the <ApiLink title="Fetch Providers" path="dedicated-virtual-account-providers" /> endpoint.
</Callout>

<RequestResponse links={{bash: "cURL", js: "Node", php: "PHP"}} filepath="/payments/dedicated-virtual-account/create-dedicated-virtual-account" />

### Account naming
When the customer attempts to make a transfer to the created account number, the account name would be in the format: <strong></strong>
  <OrderedList items={[
    <span> <strong>Access Bank - Product Name Customer Name. </strong> </span>,
    <span> <strong>Wema Bank - Product Name / Customer Name. </strong></span>
  ]} />

<Callout type="info" title="Account Limit">
  By default, you can generate up to 1000 dedicated bank accounts for your customers. This limit can be increased upon review of your business and use-case. To increase the limit for your business, please send an email to support@paystack.com
</Callout>


  <Callout type="info" title="Testing Dedicated Virtual Accounts">
          To create Dedicated Virtual Accounts using your test secret key, use <code>test-bank</code> as the <code>preferred_bank</code> in the request body parameters.
          
          You can also make a transfer to the test virtual accounts using our  <Link to="https://demobank.paystackintegrations.com/"> demo bank</Link> app.
  </Callout>


## Get a customer's dedicated virtual account
If you want to retrieve a customer's dedicated virtual account, call the <ApiLink title="Fetch Customer" path="customer-fetch" /> endpoint. You can retrieve the dedicated virtual account from the `dedicated_account` object in the response:

<Tabs links={{json: "JSON"}} filepath="/payments/dedicated-virtual-account/customer.js" />





## Requery a customer's dedicated virtual account
When a customer makes a transfer to a dedicated virtual account, a transaction is automatically created for the customer, and a webhook is sent to your server to notify you of the transaction. This typically happens within a few minutes. 

However, in some cases, the notification could take longer to come in. When this happens, the customer might reach out to you that their account/wallet hasn't been credited, or they would try to refresh their balance in your application.

In this scenario, you can use the  <ApiLink title="Requery Dedicated Virtual Account" path="dedicated-virtual-account-requery" />  endpoint to check the virtual account for new transactions that haven't been processed yet. Calling this endpoint will trigger a background requery process, and if any pending transactions are found, the transaction will be created, and the webhook notification will be sent to your server.
 
<RequestResponse links={{bash: "cURL", js: "Node", php: "PHP"}} filepath="/payments/dedicated-virtual-account/requery" />

<Callout type="warning" title="Rate Limit">
  You're only allowed to requery a dedicated virtual account once every ten minutes. If you try to requery a dedicated virtual account more than once in a 10 minute window, the request won't be processed.
</Callout>
