## Introduction
With this feature, when an attempt to charge a card fails with insufficient funds, we will automatically retry with the maximum amount that can be charged.  For example, if you attempt to charge someone NGN 10,000 but they only have NGN 4,000 in their account, historically, the transaction will fail with `insufficient funds`, but with partial debits, we will charge about NGN 3,900,

## Who can use this?
This feature is only available on request. You will gain access once our reviews team approves it. Please reach out to `hello@paystack.com` to request access.

## How does it work?
You can only charge existing authorizations with this feature. There are 2 ways to use it. Either through the <ApiLink title="Partial Debit" path="transaction-partial-debit" /> endpoint or our <ApiLink title="Bulk Charge" path="bulk-charge-initiate" /> endpoint. 

<Callout type="info" title="Using the Bulk Charge endpoint">
  When using the bulk charge endpoint you need to pass the flag <code>"attempt_partial_debit" : true</code>
</Callout>



## Verifying Transactions
When verifying transactions (or implementing webhooks) that involve Partial Debits, there are two types of amounts that are returned: <code>amount</code> and <code>requested_amount</code>. <code>amount</code> is the amount (in kobo) that the customer was charged while <code>requested_amount</code> is the amount (in kobo) you intended to charge.
