## Crafting Metadata

With metadata, you can add additional parameters that an endpoint doesn't accept naturally. Crafting metadata will depend on your language's handling of JSON. Common metadata are:
<UnorderedList items={["Invoice ID", "Cart ID", "Cart Items", "Payment medium (site/app)"]} />

There are two ways to add parameters to the metadata object:

<OrderedList items={[
  <span><strong>Key/value pair</strong>: You pass the parameter as a key and value pair like this: <code>cart_id: IU929</code>. Parameters passed this way don't show up on the dashboard, however, they are returned with the API response.</span>,
  <span><strong>Custom Fields</strong>: The <code>custom_fields</code> key is reserved for an array of custom fields that should show on the dashboard when you click the transaction.</span>,
  ]} 
/> 

Custom fields have 3 keys: `display_name`, `variable_name`, and `value`. The display name will be the label for the value when displaying.

## Cancel Action

You can redirect your users to a chosen URL when they cancel a payment. This is done by setting a `cancel_action` in your metadata:

```json
"metadata": {
  "cancel_action": "https://your-cancel-url.com"
}
```

## Custom Filters
Custom filters allow you control how a transaction is completed.

### Recurring (boolean)
If you need to directly debit the customer in future, specify `recurring=true` under this object to ensure we accept only verve cards that support recurring billing. And force a bank authentication for MasterCard and VISA.


### Banks (array)
If you only want some particular bank(s) cards to be accepted for a transaction, specify the bank codes in the object thus: `banks: ["057","100"]` . To get the list of bank codes supported, please check this API endpoint: <ApiLink title="List Banks" path="miscellaneous-bank" />.

### Card Brands (array)
If you only want some particular card brand(s) to be accepted for a transaction, specify the brands in the object thus: `brands: ["visa","verve"]` 

<Tabs links={{json: "JSON"}} filepath="/payments/custom-filters/metadata.js" />

This would mean the transaction is intended to be for enrolling on a recurring billing platform. And we should only accept a visa card from Zenith (057) or Suntrust bank (100).

All keys are optional.
